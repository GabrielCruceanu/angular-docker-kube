# AngularDockerKube

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

This project is a server side rendered Angular application that is dockerized and deployed to kubernetes.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Angular CLI
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Minikube
- Virtualbox
- Docker Hub Account
- Docker Desktop
- Brew

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
